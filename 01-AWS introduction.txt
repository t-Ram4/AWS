1. Cloud computing

Before Cloud, people face the problems while they host a website. In order to host a web application, 
Problems:
1. they require many servers and they are very expensive.
2. Other than peak time,most of the servers are idle
3. Need to maintain the hardware and software of those servers.

Solution:
1. Instead of buying servers we can rent it from Cloud providers
2. We can scale up or scale down based on the need 
3. Maintainence of the servers is taken care by Cloud providers so we can focus on business problems.
